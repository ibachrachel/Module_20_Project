# Final Project: Collaborate Capstone
### Group Number 5: Saturday Night Five

## Presentation 

- Selected Topic: Environmental Changes

- Reason for Topic: Changes to the environment should be monitored through data tracking, so that proper precautions can be taken to reduce climate change and improve the ecological balances. 

- Description of Data Source: CDP Dataset, includes responses to three surveys for the years of 2018-2020
1. corporate climate change disclosures
2. coroporate water security disclosures
3. disclosures from cities

- Questions to Answer
a. How are cities and corporations differently reporting their contribution to climate change? 
b. Are they reporting climate change in similar levels? 
c. Out of them both, is there a way that they might be able to work together to solve problems? 

## GitHub

*Communication Protocols*

Communication will take place through the Slack chat and requires each group member to contribute to the conversation daily. 
In the case of emergency, the member will be contacted through their personal email. 

*Group Roles*

Each group member has made a branch that they will submit changes from, which are then merged to the main. Different topics and actions will be seperated via new branches being made. Only functional code, documentation, and resources will be merged directly with the main immediately. 

------------------------------------------------------
Square: The team member in the square role will be responsible for the repository. 

- Rachel 

Triangle: The member in the triangle role will create a mockup of a machine learning model. This can even be a diagram that explains how it will work concurrently with the rest of the project steps.

- Scott

Circle: The member in the circle role will create a mockup of a database with a set of sample data, or even fabricated data. This will ensure the database will work seamlessly with the rest of the project.

- Stephen

X: The member in the X role will decide which technologies will be used for each step of the project.

## Machine Learning Model

- takes in data from provisional database
- outputs label for input data

## Database Integration

- Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema
- Draft machine learning model is connected to the provisional database

## Dashboard

- no dashboard required (yet)
