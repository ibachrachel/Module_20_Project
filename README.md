# Final Project: Collaborate Capstone
### Group Number 5: Saturday Night Five

## Presentation 

- Selected Topic: Life Expectancy

- Reason for Topic: Throughout the centuries, life expectancy has increased due to improvements made to the environment in which a population lives in. This increase in life expectancy can be accounted for by analyzing factors that might contribute to a healthier life, such as economical factors, social factors, and mortality factors. 

- Description of Data Source: Both datasets come from the World Health Organization (WHO) and they cover the most recent health statistics of the world. One dataset  includes various indicators of health and the percentages of individuals with access to these factors. The second dataset includes information about how life expectancy has increased or decreased in countries around the world. 

a. Life Expectancy (WHO) https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who 

b. World Health Statistics 2020 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshxy/who-worldhealth-statistics-2020-complete?select=safelySanitization.csv

*Questions to Answer*
 
a. Which countries have an increase in life expectancy? Which countries did not?

b. Out of the countries with life expectancy changes, which factors affected this statistical the most?

c. Going forward, humanitarian efforts can be focused on what areas of the world? And, what factors showed the most effect on world health.

#### Resources

- Software: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, Tableau 2022.1, Google Slides, Git Bash, Slack, R

- Database: postgreSQL, pgAdmin, AWS

## GitHub

*Communication Protocols*

Communication will take place through the Slack chat and requires each group member to contribute to the conversation regularly. Project meetings occur every Monday and Wednesday from 5 pm - 7 pm on weekdays.  
In the case of emergency, the member will be contacted through their personal email. Everyone shall clearly communicate what they plan to work on and complete between class meetings. 

*Branching*

Each group member has made a branch that they will submit changes from, which are then merged to the main. Different topics and actions will be seperated via new branches being made. Only functional code, documentation, and resources will be merged directly with the main immediately. 

------------------------------------------------------
*Group Roles*

Square: The team member in the square role will be responsible for the repository. 

- Rachel 

Triangle: The member in the triangle role will create a mockup of a machine learning model. This can even be a diagram that explains how it will work concurrently with the rest of the project steps.

- Scott

Circle: The member in the circle role will create a mockup of a database with a set of sample data, or even fabricated data. This will ensure the database will work seamlessly with the rest of the project.

- Stephen

X: The member in the X role will decide which technologies will be used for each step of the project.

- Teddi


## Machine Learning Model

- takes in data from provisional database
- outputs label for input data

## Database Integration

- Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema
- Draft machine learning model is connected to the provisional database

## Technologies Used

### Data Cleaning and Analysis

Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python or R, for additional statistical analysis.

### Database Storage

AWS is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate pgAdmin to display the data.

### Machine Learning

We will be doing supervised machine learning, utilizing multiple linear regression to predict life expectancy based on a variety of inputs. Tidyverse and ggplot will be used in R to work on the analysis.

### Dashboard

In addition to using a javascript template, we will also Tableau for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard. It will be hosted on GitHub pages.
